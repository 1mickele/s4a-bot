 Python CLI I developed to automate the seat reservation process at my university during COVID-19 restrictions in 2022. Initially utilizing Selenium for automated form interactions on the webpage, I later upgraded its functionality by integrating it directly with the app's API. Towards the end of the project, I discovered a bug that allowed bypassing the reservation cap, which I exploited to secure seats for my friends as well.
